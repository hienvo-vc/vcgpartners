					<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
					<p>
						VCG Partners was established in 2009 and holds a Capital Markets
						Services License for Fund Management issued by the Monetary
						Authority of Singapore. VCG Partners (VCGP) is a wholly-owned
						subsidiary of
						<a href="https://vinacapital.com">VinaCapital</a>, 
						one of Vietnam’s leading investment management firms, with a
						diversified portfolio of USD3.3 billion in AUM. We offer services
						such as Separately Managed Accounts and Capital Markets &
						Alternative Investment Strategies.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h5>Investing in Vietnam</h5>
					<br />
					<p>
						With Asia’s fastest urbanization rate, Vietnam is home to nearly 100
						million people – half below the age of 35 - and a fast-growing
						middle class eager to improve their lives. These factors contribute
						to a robust domestic consumption story that helps propel economic
						growth that consistently ranks as one of the world’s fastest.
						Vietnam has quickly become a manufacturing hub in the region with
						many of the world’s leading manufacturers are moving their
						production to Vietnam, benefitting from competitive wages, a largely
						educated workforce, and a stable government that has signed the most
						Free Trade Agreements in Southeast Asia.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h5>Singapore as the Gateway to Southeast Asia</h5>
					<br />
					<p>
						Independent and efficient judiciary, conducive tax environment for
						the fund manager and the funds it manages and easy access to the
						full range of fund professionals in the industry for advice and
						support are just some of the key elements that gain Singapore’s
						prominence as a reputable international financial center. In
						addition, strong political stability has landscaped the nation into
						an environment where the laws and regulations are clear, business
						friendly and progressive.
