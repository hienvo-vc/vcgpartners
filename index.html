					</h4>
					<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
					<p>
						Established in 2009, VCG Partners holds a Capital Markets Services License for Fund Management issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. 
						VCG Partners is a wholly owned subsidiary of
						<a href="https://vinacapital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VinaCapital</a>, 
						one of Vietnam’s leading investment management firms, with a diversified portfolio of over USD 3 billion in assets under management. 
						We offer a range of services, including separately managed accounts and Capital Markets & Alternative Investment Strategies. 
					</p>
					<br />
					<h5>Investing in Vietnam</h5>
					<br />
					<p>
						Home to nearly 100 million people – half below the age of 35 – Vietnam has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Rapid urbanization – the fastest in Asia – and an expanding middle class eager to improve their lives are contributing to a robust domestic consumption story that helps propel economic growth. 
						Vietnam is quickly becoming a manufacturing hub in the region, with many of the world’s leading manufacturers moving their production to the country, benefitting from competitive wages, an educated workforce, and a stable government that has signed the greatest number of free trade agreements in Southeast Asia. 
					</p>
					<br />
					<h5>Singapore as the Gateway to Southeast Asia</h5>
					<br />
					<p>
						Singapore has long served as a gateway for investing in Southeast Asia thanks to its independent and efficient judiciary, a conducive tax system, and business-friendly laws and regulations. 
						Today, the city-state is one of the world’s leading financial centers, with a stable government that continues to create a welcoming environment for fund managers and other global businesses.
