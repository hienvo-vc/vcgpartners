					<br />
					<h5>Singapore as the Gateway to Southeast Asia</h5>
					<br />
					<p>
						Singapore has long served as a gateway for investing in Southeast Asia thanks to its independent and efficient judiciary, a conducive tax system, and business-friendly laws and regulations. 
						Today, the city-state is one of the world’s leading financial centers, with a stable government that continues to create a welcoming environment for fund managers and other global businesses.
