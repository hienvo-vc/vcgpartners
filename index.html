						Services License for Fund Management issued by the Monetary

					<h5>Investing in Vietnam</h5>
					<br />
					<p>
						With Asia’s fastest urbanization rate, Vietnam is home to nearly 100
						million people – half below the age of 35 - and a fast-growing
						middle class eager to improve their lives. These factors contribute
						to a robust domestic consumption story that helps propel economic
						growth that consistently ranks as one of the world’s fastest.
						Vietnam has quickly become a manufacturing hub in the region with
						many of the world’s leading manufacturers are moving their
						production to Vietnam, benefitting from competitive wages, a largely
						educated workforce, and a stable government that has signed the most
						Free Trade Agreements in Southeast Asia
					</p>
					<br />
					<h5>Singapore as the Gateway to Southeast Asia</h5>
					<br />
					<p>
						Independent and efficient judiciary, conducive tax environment for
						the fund manager and the funds it manages and easy access to the
						full range of fund professionals in the industry for advice and
						support are just some of the key elements that gain Singapore’s
						prominence as a reputable international financial center. In
						addition, strong political stability has landscaped the nation into
						an environment where the laws and regulations are clear, business
						friendly and progressive.

											Southeast Asia is a vibrant and diverse part of the world.
											Over the years, the region’s economy has been benefitting
											from demographic tailwinds that standout relative to other
											regions namely: active consumers, growing middle class and
											increasing literacy, especially in English Language. With
											macroeconomic policies pursued by countries in the region
											and cooperation initiatives at the regional level that
											strengthen the region’s strong economic credentials,
											Southeast Asia has been able to sustain its steady GDP
											growth thus far. Rest assured, the story of its growth is
											just getting started.
